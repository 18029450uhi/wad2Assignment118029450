# Web Application Development 2  
## Introduction  

This project is based on converting monolithic application into microservices. A microservices architecture is aimed to improve scalability, maintainability, and flexibility of the existing system with contrast to a monolithic application . This architecture aims to break down the monolithic structure into smaller, independent services, assisting easier development, deployment, and management. The IWTSC container has been decomposed into front-end react app, API for Auth server and Question server and PostgresSQL and MongoDB database. The Authentication system has been kept in postgresDB and the question section has been moved to MongoDB and delivered from there. The alevelcomputing site has been unchanged. It has been integrated into IWTSC, where the record of correct answers has been applied. When accessed from IWTSC, the question and answers on the of alevelcomputing site is shown in a single page.
